- 👋 Hi, I’m @SpaceDubby07 or Zach
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, 3d printing, food, Anime, Kayaking, Nature, Biology, Web and Mobile App development, IT support, and a bunch of other stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and React/React Native/Redux/React Redux
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything
- 💻 Most of my public commited repositories are concepts and ideas, unfinished, although usable if anyone is inclined to use them and create their own projects based off of them
- 📫 How to reach me ... hmmm email me at zclark006@gmail.com

- 😢 lost a lot of my Udemy class coursework before having a change to upload it due to an unfortunate HDD failure I suffered from while taking my React course and Web Development course. All projects commited from those courses are data I had backed up on an external drive
